# Getting Started Guide for Developers

The Platinion Design System contains a collection of React components that can be used to build accessible and performant React applications consistent with Platinion brand guidelines. This getting started guide provides the basic instructions to install the Platinion Design System components as a dependency in your application and begin using those components. The documentation for each individual component provides more detailed information including:

- An overview with contextual usage guidance and best practices
- Examples of common variations of the component such as sizes and states
- Guidance for using the components with accessiblity in mind
- A detailed description of available React props along with an interactive playground environment

## Using this project

The Platinion Design System is typically installed into a project managed by npm or yarn as a JavaScript package from the Platinion GitHub Package Registry.

Add the Platinion scoped package registry to your list of available registries through a .npmrc file located at the root of your project:

Add this library to your project

```npmrc
always-auth=true
@platinion:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Note: Since the repository is currently private, remember to authenticate for GitHub following this guide. To sign up for an access token, please contact DesignOps and provide the following information:

- Email
- Name
- Agency/employer
- Github username (optional)

Now add this project as a dependency of your project with:

```
npm add @platinion/design-system
```

Or if you're using yarn

```
yarn add @platinion/design-system
```

### The ThemeProvider component

To use components from Platinion UI React, you need to wrap your app with a `<ThemeProvider>` component.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@platinion/design-system'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  container
)
```

#### Custom Theme for ThemeProvider

We use [Theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started) as the barebone of the library, check the documentation for more information.

The base for a custom theme is as follows:

```tsx
// src/theme/index.ts

import { theme } from '@platinion/design-system'

const customTheme: typeof theme = {
  ...theme,

  colors: {
    primary: '#FF0000',
  },
}

export { customTheme }
```

And apply the theme on `<ThemeProvider>` as follows

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@platinion/design-system'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { customTheme } from './theme'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  container
)
```
