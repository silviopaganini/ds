The documentation for each individual component provides more detailed information including:

- An overview with contextual usage guidance and best practices

## Using this project

Add this library to your project

```
npm add @platinion/design-system
```

Or if you're using yarn

```
yarn add @platinion/design-system
```

### The ThemeProvider component

To use components from Platinion UI React, you need to wrap your app with a `<ThemeProvider>` component.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@platinion/design-system";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  container
);
```

#### Custom Theme for ThemeProvider

We use [Theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/docs) as the barebone of the library, check the documentation for more information.

The base for a custom theme is as follows:

```tsx
// src/theme/index.ts

import { theme } from "@platinion/design-system";
import type { Theme } from "@platinion/design-system";

const customTheme: Theme = {
  ...theme,

  colors: {
    primary: "#FF0000",
  },
};

export { customTheme };
```

And apply the theme on `<ThemeProvider>` as follows

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@platinion/design-system";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { customTheme } from "./theme";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  container
);
```
