# Introduction to the Platinion Design System

The Platinion Design System was created to help us build products for our customers more efficiently. Established to be the single source of truth for product teams working on Platinion products across the globe, the Platinion Design System contains everything from Getting Started guides through to Core Components intended for adoption within each product. It enables product teams to design and develop with speed, consistency, and quality. Our dedicated Design Operations team works with the individual product teams across Platinion to ensure the system continues to evolve to meet the needs of our designers, developers, and customers.
